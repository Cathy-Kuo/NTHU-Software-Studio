# Bootstrap and RWD
### Goal
- Make a personal webpage using RWD
- Use bootstrap from CDN
 You can apply any template from the internet but you should provide the template's URL in your project README
- Use at least **Ten** bootstrap elements by yourself which are not included in the template
- Your web page template should reasonably fit your original personal web page content

### Step
1. Fork the repo and git clone
2. Making your own webpage in your repo
3. Push to your repo
4. Run the CI/CD pipeline to deploy Gitlab Page
5. Send Merge Request
6. Show your Gitlab Page link and local webpage to TA (*since the original repo is private so the online page link wonâ€™t work*)
